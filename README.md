# WorkManager PlayGround

A practice project on using  Android Jetpack library and one of the android architecture component - WorkManager.
WorkManager is used for performing usually deferrable task which may not be intended to be performed immediately.
WorkManager has an edge over Job Scheduler, Job Dispatcher, Alarm manager and Broadcast receiver, because it provides backward compatibility.

## Areas covered:
- OneTimeWorkRequest
- PeriodicWorkRequest
- Constraints
- Checking  Work Status
- Chained Request, and
- Cancelling requests.

## Proceses followed:
- Create a seperate class for handing the task and extend the worker class
- Override the default doWork method and class constructor
- Carry out task to be undertaken in the doWork method
- Create work request either oneTimeWorkRequest or PeriodicWorkRequest
- Add contraints if necessary
- Enqueue your work using the WorkManager  instance class.
